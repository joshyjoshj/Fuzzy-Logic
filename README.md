# Fuzzy-Logic

Two **un-finished** files of implementation of fuzzy logic inspired by the following paper. 

- [IEEE 2020 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Applications (ICAICA) - Dalian, China (2020.6.27-2020.6.29)] 2020 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Computer Applications (ICAICA) - Stock Reversal Pattern Mining Based on Fuzzy Candlestick Lines

Code includes large amounts of `tidyverse` data manipulation, `RWeka` data mining using bayesian classifier and alternating decision tree and `tidymodels` decision tree.
